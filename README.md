MyCarProjects.net Mobile Web Edition 2013

## About
MyCarProjects.net is a site where users can log and track data about their cars, including maintenance, fuel economy, and projects. The site launched in 2007 and continues to attract new users today. In addition to the main site, there is a simple mobile site for feature phones, an Android app, and this project aims to serve the rest of the smartphone market.

## Exclusions
The MyCarProjects.net database features encrypted passwords and has not had a known security breach since the site began in 2007. However, the database is using an older encryption method that is not considered state of the art today. In order to continue to protect user data, I have excluded files related to encryption until the database can be upgraded. Similarly, the Web.config file is excluded in order to hide the main database password.
